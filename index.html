        <img src="../Basic-Portfolio/assets/images/Profilepic.jpg" />
        <p>I was born and raised in Minnesota.</p>
        <p>
          I studied at St. Cloud State University and the University of
          Minnesota.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also studied abroad in England for a semester and have traveled to
          Europe three times since.
        </p>
        <p>I've managed GNC and the Vitamin Shoppe for nearly 15 years.</p>
        <p>
          Since I turned 40 last summer, I've wondered to myself, 'What's next'?
        </p>
        <p>That question has ultimately led me here to the U of MN Bootcamp!</p>
