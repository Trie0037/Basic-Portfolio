           <p>I was born and raised in Minnesota.  I studied at St. Cloud State University and the University of Minnesota.  I also studied abroad in England for a semester and have traveled to Europe three times since. I've managed GNC and the Vitamin Shoppe for nearly 15 years.  Since I turned 40 last summer, I've wondered to myself, 'What's next'?  That question has ultimately led me here to the U of MN Bootcamp!
